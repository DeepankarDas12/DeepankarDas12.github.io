			<strong>Deepankar Das</strong> is a PhD candidate in Mechanical Engineering at IIT Kanpur, advised by Prof. Basant Lal Sharma. His research employs group theory to study edge instabilities in stiffened plates, leading to publications in SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics and the International Journal of Solids and Structures. Prior to this, he earned his B.Tech and M.Tech degrees from IIT (ISM) Dhanbad, focusing on acoustics. Originally from Rourkela, Odisha, Deepankar completed his schooling at DAV Public School (Rourkela and Ranchi). Beyond his academic work, he takes a keen interest in reading about broader scientific developments and enjoys recreational video gaming.
