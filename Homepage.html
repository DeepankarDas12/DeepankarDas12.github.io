          <strong>Deepankar Das</strong> is a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering, specializing in nonlinear problems involving structural mechanics. Expertise in using commercial CAE tools like ABAQUS and COMSOL Multiphysics for advanced structural and aero-acoustic analysis as well as writing finite element codes from scratch for specialized problems. Proficient in symmetry-based nonlinear finite element analysis (FEA) techniques and experienced in tackling complex engineering challenges through both analytical and numerical methods. He also has analytical and experimental experience with aeroacoustic problems during his M.Tech degree.
