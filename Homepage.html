          <strong>Deepankar Das</strong> is a PhD student in Department of mechanical engineering at Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur. His doctoral research revolves around study of instabilities in elastic media using bifurcation analysis. Currently he is working on problems involving instabilities in rods and shells. He holds MTech in Machine design (2018) and BTech (2016) in Mechanical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology (ISM) Dhanbad. His MTech thesis was on 'Analytical and experimental investigation of generic perforated bias flow liner', in which his work mostly involved analytical modelling and numerical solution, with some experimental work.
